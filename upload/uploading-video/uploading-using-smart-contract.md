# Uploading using Smart Contract

This require knowledge about how IPFS works, How to upload to IPFS and retrieve the hash of the uploaded file. Explaining all these here will be out of the scope for this documentation.\


If you already know how to upload a file to IPFS and  retrieve the hash then you can use the `electvideo` action in the Eden contract to push the hash to the UI. Although the video needs to be pinned to Eden gateway (_<mark style="color:blue;">https://eden-genesis.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/</mark>_) by the admin to actually view it via UI.

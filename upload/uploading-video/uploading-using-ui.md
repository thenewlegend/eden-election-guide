# Uploading using UI

Once the Eden Election is over, that is after the Head Chief Delegate has been determined by random sortition, we can start uploading the videos ( for multiple rounds if applicable ) using the Eden Portal.

The upload button on the UI is fairly obvious and point and click. _<mark style="color:green;">**Be sure to Pre-Process the video for a smooth upload.**</mark>_

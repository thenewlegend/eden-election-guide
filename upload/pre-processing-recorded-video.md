# Pre - Processing Recorded Video

The recorded election video are often over 200 MB and the Eden Portal has an upload limit of 200 MB. Hence it is advised to pre-process the video with minimal settings to upload it without any issues.

**The first thing will be to compress the video down below 200 MB. The less size, the better. But we also have to keep the quality ( audio and video ) at an acceptable level.**

There are several  3rd party platforms to compress videos, both online and offline. An example for an online one is :&#x20;

**The second step would be to convert the video to mp4 , if it is not already.**&#x20;

Tools like Handbrake is useful for this. Handbrake can also compress videos, it works offline and is open-sourced.

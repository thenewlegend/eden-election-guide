# Intro to Eden Election

An Eden Election involves multiple rounds of electing a leader from a randomly selected group of individuals. In each round, the elected representatives move on to the subsequent round until a Head Chief Delegate is randomly selected in the final round.

The number of rounds that an individual participates in an Eden Election depends on their success in each round. Participants may advance to subsequent rounds, or they may be eliminated after one round. However, the procedure remains the same in each round.

The final round selection for Head Chief Delegate will be a randomized one and hence no voting is required there.

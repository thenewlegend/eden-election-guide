# Election Password

**Election Password** is necessary to allow your browser to decrypt the video meeting links for the upcoming election. This password is provided during the registration process and is stored locally in your browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
The built-in meeting links are not strictly necessary to continue with election. We will cover this  in later section.
{% endhint %}

If you happen to misplace your Election Password, you can reset it by signing a transaction with your EOS Account.

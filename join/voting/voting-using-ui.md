To cast your vote in Eden Election, you need to select the delegate you want to vote for and then click on "_**Submit Vote**_". This will trigger a transaction that needs to be signed using your EOS wallet, and once completed, your vote will be cast.&#x20;

The voting process is executed on the EOSIO blockchain using a Smart Contract. You can verify that your vote has been successfully registered by checking your account on a block explorer, where you will be able to see the vote.

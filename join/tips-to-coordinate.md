# ã€½ Tips to Coordinate

Divide the 40 minutes of each round into three sections - **Introductions, Consensus Building & Voting**. Times per person vary depending on how many members in the room. Each section provides equal time for speaking for each member and goes in a circle _(nobody speaks twice until everyone has had a chance to speak once)_

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1. Introductions" %}


**20 min** | \~ 3-5 min/person | <mark style="color:blue;">**Introductions**</mark>

* Who are you and what do you do?&#x20;
* What do you want to bring to Eden?&#x20;
* Are you running as a delegate? If so, what's your campaign?&#x20;
* If not, what are you looking for in a delegate?
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Consensus Building" %}


**10 min** | \~ 1-3 min/person | <mark style="color:blue;">**Consensus Building**</mark>

* Hopeful delegates can attempt to form and present a consensus platform (that integrates all that was shared during intros).&#x20;
* Those not wishing to be delegates can share what they believe to be a consensus campaign/project or what they believe to be the best campaign/project.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="3. Voting" %}


**10 min** | \~ 1-2 min/person | <mark style="color:blue;">**Voting**</mark>

* Now voting begins and members may (or may not) share why they're voting for who they're voting for (even if voting for self).
* This continues going in a circle until a consensus is found or until time runs out.
{% endtab %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is important to keep track of the elapsed time. Best practice is to keep the Election Portal side by side to the meeting. Vote before the time runs out. It is impossible to make any changes afterwards.

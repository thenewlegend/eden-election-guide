The UpVoteBot is a helpful tool for Eden Members as it streamlines coordination through Telegram. It automatically creates a Telegram group for each randomly allotted group in the Eden Portal and invites all members of that group to join as admins.&#x20;

This makes it easy for group members to coordinate and communicate with each other during the election process without cluttering the main Eden community group.

&#x20;<mark style="color:green;">The UpVote bot doesn't effect any aspect of the Eden Election. It is simply a companion to ensure election progress easily.</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}

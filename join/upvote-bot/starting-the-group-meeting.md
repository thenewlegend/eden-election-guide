# Starting the Group Meeting

In the past Eden used Zoom as the meeting platform and the UI has some links leading to Zoom.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Since Zoom integration is not a necessary part of Eden, has a limitation of 40 minutes for free accounts and the UpVote bot already  providing Telegram coordination, it is highly recommended to use</mark> _<mark style="color:red;">**Telegram Video Chat**</mark>_ <mark style="color:green;">to start meetings in each round.</mark>

The UpVote bot will provide instructions to start a Video Call on Telegram and  everyone in the group should make sure the meeting is recorded to be later uploaded to Eden Election Portal.

<mark style="color:orange;">**It is important that recording is stopped before exiting the group**</mark>, to ensure your group video ends up in **Saved Messages** folder of the person who started the recording.

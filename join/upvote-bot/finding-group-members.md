# Finding Group Members

After the election officially starts at **1:00 PM UTC** the first order of business is to find the members in your randomly allotted group and coordinate with them to start the meeting for each round.

<mark style="color:orange;">If you have already registered wit the UpVote bot you will be sent you the list of the members in your group and also provides a telegram group for everyone to join, sending the link in the group.</mark>

Incase you were not registered beforehand and haven't gotten any links during the election, find who are in your group using the Election Portal <mark style="color:green;">and ask them for group invite link</mark> :&#x20;

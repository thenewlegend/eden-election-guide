# Meeting Platforms

It is essential to consider the following points when selecting a platform :

1. The platform should enable recording of both audio and video, preferably for all participants and not just the person who started the meeting.
2. All members of the group should be informed of the chosen platform.
3. No access barriers should be present. If a password is required, all group members should have access.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure that everyone in the group can participate in the meeting without any issues and that the recording is accessible to all members.
